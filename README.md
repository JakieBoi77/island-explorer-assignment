## Project Description

My colleagues and I were hired by the Outer Wilds Department of ACME Corp (A Company that Makes Everything) to contribute to their Rescue Drone System project. The system's primary goal was to facilitate the rescue of individuals by identifying safe landing zones for rescue teams on unexplored islands.

The Outer Wilds Department specializes in outdoor rescue and has developed cutting-edge, long-range drone technology capable of operating in vast and hostile environments. However, they faced a significant challenge in their development process. They had focused heavily on perfecting the droneâ€™s hardware but delayed the design and implementation of the controller software. While the hardware was completed after several months and ready for deployment, the system lacked the necessary software to fully function.

Our team was brought in to address this critical gap, ensuring the integration of a robust, iterative, and incremental software solution to make the Rescue Drone System operational.

## Product Description

This product is an _exploration command center_ for the [Island](https://ace-design.github.io/island/) serious game. 

- The `ca.mcmaster.se2aa4.island.team_XXX_.Explorer` class implements the command center, used to compete with the others. (XXX being the team identifier)
- The `Runner` class allows one to run the command center on a specific map.


## How to compile, run and deploy

### Compiling the project:

```
mosser@azrael a2-template % mvn clean package
...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  0.960 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-01-20T18:26:43-05:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
mosser@azrael a2-template % 
```

This creates one jar file in the `target` directory, named after the team identifier (i.e., team 00 uses `team00-1.0.jar`).

As the project is intended to run in the competition arena, this jar is not executable. 

### Run the project

The project is not intended to be started by the user, but instead to be part of the competition arena. However, one might one to execute their command center on local files for testing purposes.

To do so, we ask maven to execute the `Runner` class, using a map provided as parameter:

```
mosser@azrael a2-template % mvn exec:java -q -Dexec.args="./maps/map03.json"
```

It creates three files in the `outputs` directory:

- `_pois.json`: the location of the points of interests
- `Explorer_Island.json`: a transcript of the dialogue between the player and the game engine
- `Explorer.svg`: the map explored by the player, with a fog of war for the tiles that were not visited.
